# Jsass (Json-Sass) is a tool to convert JSON to Sass variables.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple way to convert JSON to Sass variables and vice versa.

The goal is **not** to compile Sass to CSS, this is done using [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install).

I aim to provide a simple way to install Sass on different machines and operating systems aswell in the future, but at the moment being able to edit Sass variables in a JSON file is the main goal.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jsass
```

## Usage

```bash
jsass --help
```

Will show you what's currently available.

In a few words, it's reasonable to say I secured the Sass to JSON conversion, but the JSON to Sass conversion is still a work in progress.  
I also need to test the Sass to JSON conversion on different machines and operating systems.
